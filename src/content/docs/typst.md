Standalone `.typ` ([Typst](https://typst.app)) files get the same 3-mode view
(Editor / Split / Preview) as Markdown, rendered off-thread by the external
**`typst`** CLI as a **multi-page** stack, one image per page.

The last good render stays on screen as you edit, without flicker, and a
compile error keeps the pages visible under a small
banner. Zoom resizes the pages.

## Editing

Typst files get Markdown-style ergonomics:

- Enter continues a `-` / `+` / `N.` list.
- Selecting text pops a **format bar** (bold `*`, emphasis `_`, raw `` ` ``,
  link, bullet, heading), with matching right-click and palette actions
  (`typst.bold`, `typst.emph`, `typst.raw`, `typst.link`, `typst.bulletList`,
  `typst.headingPromote` / `Demote`).
- Insert a table, image, or table of contents (`typst.insertTable`,
  `typst.insertImage`, `typst.outline`).
- Bundled snippets cover figures, tables, and more.

Code intelligence comes from the **tinymist** language server (enable the
[LSP feature](/docs/lsp) and install tinymist).

Editing actions are grouped under a single **Typst** submenu in the editor's
right-click menu. Listed flat, the eight entries would push cut, copy, paste
and the spelling suggestions well down the menu. Run and Debug stay at the top
level, because they are the two entries people reach for without reading the
menu.

## Structure and folding

A `.typ` file **folds and outlines by section**. Headings (`=`, `==`, …) drive
both, so the Structure window reads as the document's own table of contents and
a section collapses like one. Folding at `#align` / `#table` brackets still
works alongside it, and a long embedded listing collapses at its ` ``` ` fence,
which is usually the thing you most want out of the way.

`#let` and `#show` bindings join the outline in document order, each nested
under the section it is written in (one above the first heading stays at the
root). A template file can be almost entirely bindings, and an outline of
headings alone would leave such a file with an empty Structure window.

Three forms are left out, because each would add noise to the outline:

- **`#set`**, which configures the document rather than defining anything. A
  run of `#set page` / `#set text` would top most files.
- **An indented `#let`**, inside a function body, naming something that means
  nothing outside it.
- **Destructuring and `#show:` forms**, which name nothing you could jump to.

The parser has to tell a section marker from every other `=` in a Typst file
(an assignment in `#let x = 1`, an equality inside math, a rule of `=`
characters) and from anything written inside a raw block, a line comment or one
of Typst's nesting block comments. Folding and the outline share one
parser, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about where a section begins.

## Export

Export the document with `typst.export`: **PDF** (a native single file), **PNG**,
or **SVG** (also `typst.exportPng` / `typst.exportSvg`). Printing paginates the
pages.

PNG and SVG write one file per page. A **one-page** document is written under
the name you chose (`report.png`); a longer one becomes numbered page files
(`report-1.png`, `report-2.png`, …). When any of those page files already exist,
the export lists them and asks before replacing them; cancelling replaces
nothing.

The PDF is laid out by Typst itself, so the page size, orientation and margins
come from the document (`#set page(…)`) rather than from Editora's
[Export & Print settings](/docs/print-pdf#settings).

## Enabling

It's **on by default**, self-gating on detection, so it stays inert until the
`typst` CLI is found. Install it with your package manager
(`brew install typst`, `cargo install typst-cli`) or the in-app **Install…**
button (`install.typstCli`). The toggle and tool path live under **Settings →
Typst**.
