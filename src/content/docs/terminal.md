The **Terminal** tool window runs shells inside Editora, one per tab, at the
bottom of the window: on your computer, or where a project's commands run,
on a [remote host](#terminals-on-a-host-in-a-container-or-in-wsl), in a dev
container or in a WSL distribution. A focused terminal owns the keyboard, so
Ctrl+C, Escape, and your shell's own shortcuts work as they do in any terminal.
Its colors follow the editor theme and its font is the editor's, and a
Ctrl+click (⌘-click on macOS) on a file name in the output opens that file in
the editor.

## Open a terminal

**Tool Window: Terminal** (`tool.terminal`) shows the tool window and starts a
shell if none is running. When the Terminal is open but the keyboard is
elsewhere, it moves the keyboard into the terminal; run it from inside the
terminal to hide the window. A hidden Terminal's shells keep running, and the
next toggle brings them back. The Window menu has **Terminal** and **New
Terminal**, and the File menu has **Open Terminal Here**.

| Action | Command | Emacs | IntelliJ IDEA | VS Code, CUA, Sublime Text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Show, focus or hide the Terminal | `tool.terminal` | `M-0` | Alt+F12 (⌥F12 on macOS) | Ctrl+\` |
| Open another terminal | `terminal.new` | (palette) | (palette) | Ctrl+Shift+\` |
| Back to the editor, leaving the Terminal open | `terminal.focusEditor` | Shift+Escape | Shift+Escape | Shift+Escape |
| Close the selected terminal | `terminal.close` | (palette) | (palette) | (palette) |
| Find in the selected terminal | `terminal.find` | (palette) | (palette) | (palette) |
| Next or previous terminal tab | `terminal.next`, `terminal.previous` | (palette) | (palette) | (palette) |
| Rename the selected tab | `terminal.rename` | (palette) | (palette) | (palette) |
| Move the selected tab left or right | `terminal.moveTabLeft`, `terminal.moveTabRight` | (palette) | (palette) | (palette) |

Ctrl+\` is the Control key on macOS too, as in VS Code. Run the commands
marked (palette) from the command palette, which also works from inside a
terminal (see [Keys](#keys)). Inside a terminal, Find, switching tabs and
moving tabs also have keys of their own, the same in every keymap: see
[The terminal's own keys](#the-terminals-own-keys). The **+** at the right end
of the tab strip opens another terminal as well.

A Terminal left open when Editora quits is open again at the next start, with
a new shell; it starts without taking the keyboard from the editor.

## Terminal tabs

Each tab carries a chip saying where its shell runs (**Local**, or the host's,
container's or distribution's name). Its title is the title the shell or its
program sets, or else the name of its current folder; pointing at the tab
shows the whole folder. Tabs with the same title are numbered: `project`,
`project (2)`.

A tab's right-click menu has **Rename Tab…**, **New Terminal**, **Close**,
**Close Other Tabs**, **Close Tabs to the Right**, **Move Tab Left** and
**Move Tab Right**. A renamed tab keeps its name whatever its shell sets;
renaming it to an empty name gives it back the shell's title. Drag a tab by
its header to move it.

When a program rings the bell in a tab you can't see, the tab is marked until
you look at it.

A tab closes when you click its **✕**, run **Terminal: Close Terminal**, or the
shell exits (`exit`, or Ctrl+D at an empty prompt). When the last shell exits
or its tab closes, the Terminal tool window hides and the editor has the
keyboard again. Closing the window ends its shells. Closing a tab, a window or
Editora while a shell is running a program
[asks first](#closing-a-busy-terminal).

## Open Terminal Here

**Open Terminal Here** opens a new terminal tab in a particular folder. It is in
a tab's right-click menu, the Project tree's right-click menu, the
breadcrumb's menu, and the File menu, and it is the **File: Open Terminal
Here** (`file.openTerminal`) command, which uses the active file's folder. On a
folder in the Project tree it uses that folder; on a file, the file's folder.
If the Terminal tool window had no shell yet, it opens with just that tab, not
with a second shell in the project folder beside it.

To use your system's terminal app instead, turn on **Settings → Terminal →
Open Terminal Here uses the system terminal**. Open Terminal Here then starts
your system's terminal application, and the Terminal tool window is left alone.

On a file or folder of a [remote project](/docs/remote), Open Terminal Here
opens a terminal on that host, in that folder, whatever the system-terminal
setting says. In [Simple UI mode](/docs/workspace#focus-modes) the trimmed
right-click menus leave it out; the command still works.

For a [deployment](/docs/deployments), **Run → Deployment → Open Terminal in
Deployment** (`deploy.terminal`) opens a tab on the host, in the deployment's
folder.

## Where a shell starts

A new shell started from the Terminal tool window, rather than by Open
Terminal Here, starts in the first of these that applies:

1. The project's folder: on this computer, or on its host for a
   [remote project](/docs/remote).
2. The folder of the active file, when it is a file on this computer.
3. Your home folder.

On this computer the shell is the one **Settings → Terminal → Shell** names,
or else your own:

- **macOS and Linux:** your login shell (`$SHELL`), started as a login shell
  so it reads your profile. Without `$SHELL` it is zsh on macOS and bash on
  Linux, else `sh`.
- **Windows:** PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) when it is installed, else Windows
  PowerShell, else the command prompt (`%COMSPEC%`, `cmd.exe`).

The setting takes a path or a program on your `PATH`, followed by any
arguments, such as `/bin/bash --norc` or `pwsh -NoLogo`. A shell named without
arguments starts as a login shell (on Windows, only bash and zsh do). When
the shell it names can't be found or run, the terminal starts your own shell
instead and the status bar says why.

The shell runs with the same `PATH` additions as programs Editora runs, and
with `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor`, `TERM_PROGRAM=Editora` and
`TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` set.

## Terminals on a host, in a container or in WSL

A folder whose commands run somewhere else gets its terminal there too: a
remote project's terminal is a shell on its SSH host, and a folder whose tools
run in a [dev container](/docs/remote#tools-in-a-container) or a
[WSL distribution](/docs/remote#tools-in-wsl-windows) gets a shell inside it.
The tab's chip names the host, container or distribution, so you can tell at a
glance where a command will run.

- **It is a real terminal.** vim, htop, less and resizing work, as in `ssh`.
- **It is the account's login shell there**: `$SHELL`, else bash, else sh.
  Settings → Terminal → Shell names a program on this computer, so it is never
  sent to a host.
- **Allowed places only.** A terminal runs commands there, so it opens only
  where Editora may run commands: a host you
  [allowed](/docs/remote#allowing-a-host-to-run-commands), or an allowed
  [container](/docs/remote#allowing-a-container) or
  [distribution](/docs/remote#allowing-a-distribution). It's the same permission
  Run, Git and language servers use.
- **It opens without freezing the window.** The tab says *Connecting to …*
  until the shell is there.
- **Each terminal on an SSH host uses one of the connection's channels for
  long-running programs**, as a Run or a language server does. When all are in
  use, opening another says so; close a terminal or stop a program first.

**When the connection drops**, the host ends the shell and the programs in its
foreground, as it does when an `ssh` session drops. Programs started with
`nohup` or inside tmux or screen survive. The tab keeps what it printed under a
**Connection lost** banner with **Reconnect**, which starts a new shell in the
same folder once the connection is back.

In a container or WSL there is no connection to lose: when the container stops,
the shell ends and its tab closes. Closing a terminal ends the shell inside the
container too.

## Shell integration

With bash or zsh, the terminal knows where the shell is and where each command
starts and ends. Editora starts the shell with a small script of its own that
first runs your usual startup files (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc` and the
rest), so your prompt, aliases and `PATH` are as always, and none of your
files are changed. It works the same on a host, in a container and in WSL,
where the script is kept in `~/.cache/editora`.

What it gives you:

- **The tab follows the shell's folder**, on any machine, and relative paths
  in the output open the right file (see
  [Open files and links](#open-files-and-links-from-the-output)).
- **New Terminal Here** in the terminal's right-click menu opens another tab in
  the shell's current folder.
- **Jump between prompts** with **Ctrl+Shift+Up** and **Ctrl+Shift+Down**
  (**⌘↑** and **⌘↓** on macOS), to scroll back to where each command started.
- **Copy Last Command Output** in the right-click menu copies what the last
  command printed. The item is there only when the shell has marked its
  prompts.

It is on by default; turn it off with **Settings → Terminal → Shell
integration**, which applies from the next terminal you open. Other shells,
such as fish or PowerShell, start without it.

## Find in the terminal

**Ctrl+Shift+F** (**⌘F** on macOS), **Terminal: Find** (`terminal.find`), or
**Find…** in the terminal's right-click menu opens a find bar over the
terminal. Every match in the scrollback and on the screen is highlighted, and
the current one starts at the most recent match:

- **Enter** goes to the next match up, toward older output, and **Shift+Enter**
  down. Both wrap around.
- **Aa** matches case.
- **Escape** closes the bar and gives the keyboard back to the shell.

The bar counts the matches, up to 1,000; past that it says *1000+* and keeps
the newest. Matches stay on their text as more output scrolls in. Text
selected on one line, when there is some, is what the bar starts with.

## Keys

While a terminal has focus, keys go to the shell, not to Editora:

- **Ctrl+C** interrupts the running program, **Ctrl+W** deletes a word, and
  **Ctrl+R** searches the shell's history.
- **Escape** reaches vim, less, and other full-screen programs. **Shift+Escape**
  (`terminal.focusEditor`) is how you get back to the editor without closing
  the Terminal.
- Key sequences belong to the shell: in the Emacs keymap, `C-x` and the
  `M-g …` sequences inside the terminal are Emacs's or readline's, not
  Editora's.

Only a few commands still reach Editora from a terminal. By default they are:

- the tool-window toggles (`tool.*`), so you can open the Project tree or hide
  the Terminal without leaving it;
- the command palette (`palette.show`);
- Search Everywhere (`search.everywhere`);
- the terminal commands (`terminal.*`).

Even those reach Editora only on a key a shell has no use for, such as a
Ctrl+Shift or Alt+Shift chord, Ctrl+\`, or Alt+F12. A key a shell uses goes to
the shell whatever the keymap binds to it: a plain Ctrl+letter, Ctrl+digit,
Alt+letter or Alt+digit, and any key without Ctrl or Alt, F-keys included. So
IntelliJ's Ctrl+K, VS Code's Ctrl+B and F1, the Emacs keymap's `M-1` … `M-9`
and IntelliJ's Alt+1 … Alt+9 tool windows go to the shell. A command gets
through only when its shortcut is a single chord.

Of the commands on the list, two kinds pass on any key:

- the Terminal's own commands (`tool.terminal` and `terminal.*`), so there is
  always a way out: `M-0` in the Emacs keymap and Shift+Escape in every
  keymap work from inside a terminal;
- the Emacs keymap's `M-x`, which opens the command palette from a terminal.

On macOS, every ⌘ shortcut reaches Editora too, listed or not, since a shell
has no use for ⌘. The terminal's own ⌘ keys, below, stay with the terminal.

Change the list in **Settings → Terminal → Commands that reach Editora**:
entries separated by commas, where an entry is a command id, or ends in `.*`
to cover every command that starts with it. An entry can also be a key,
written as Editora's keymaps write it, such as `M-1`: that key then reaches
Editora whatever command it is bound to. Every other key stays with the shell.
Changes apply to open terminals.

### The terminal's own keys

These belong to the terminal itself, in every keymap, and reach neither the
shell nor Editora's keymap:

| Action | Linux and Windows | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copy the selection | Ctrl+Shift+C | ⌘C |
| Paste | Ctrl+Shift+V | ⌘V |
| [Find](#find-in-the-terminal) | Ctrl+Shift+F | ⌘F |
| [Jump to the previous or next prompt](#shell-integration) | Ctrl+Shift+Up, Ctrl+Shift+Down | ⌘↑, ⌘↓ |
| Next or previous terminal tab | Ctrl+PageDown, Ctrl+PageUp | Ctrl+PageDown, Ctrl+PageUp |
| Move the selected tab right or left | Ctrl+Shift+PageDown, Ctrl+Shift+PageUp | Ctrl+Shift+PageDown, Ctrl+Shift+PageUp |
| Scroll the history a page up or down | Shift+PageUp, Shift+PageDown | Shift+PageUp, Shift+PageDown |
| Scroll to the top of the history, or back to the prompt | Shift+Home, Shift+End | Shift+Home, Shift+End |

The history keys scroll the terminal's scrollback. In a full-screen program
such as vim or less, which has no scrollback, they go to the program.

### Alt and Option

On Linux and Windows, Alt is the shell's Meta key: Alt+B and Alt+F move by
words in readline, as `M-b` and `M-f`. On macOS, Option types the characters
your keyboard layout puts on it, such as @ [ ] { } on many layouts. Turn on
**Settings → Terminal → Option key as Meta (macOS)** to make Option the
shell's Meta key instead.

### Copy and paste

The terminal's own Copy and Paste are **Ctrl+Shift+C** and **Ctrl+Shift+V**
(**⌘C** and **⌘V** on macOS). Plain Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V belong to the shell.
Double-click selects a word and triple-click a line. In a program that reads
the mouse, such as htop, vim or tmux, hold **Shift** to select text instead
of clicking in the program.

The terminal's right-click menu has Copy, Paste, Select All, Copy Last Command
Output, Clear Scrollback, New Terminal Here and Find…, and, on a link, Open
Link and Copy Link Address (see
[Open files and links](#open-files-and-links-from-the-output)). Clear
Scrollback drops the history and keeps what is on the screen.

A paste is text, never keystrokes: control characters in the clipboard are
dropped, so a paste can't run a command on its own or end bash's bracketed
paste early. Pasting several lines into a program that would run each line as
it arrives, such as `sh`, a REPL or an older remote shell, asks first, with
**Cancel** as the default. bash and zsh mark a paste and never ask. **Don't ask
again** in the question turns off **Settings → Terminal → Confirm a paste of
several lines**.

## Open files and links from the output

Hold **Ctrl** (**⌘** on macOS) and point at a file name, a path, or a URL in the
terminal's output: it is underlined when it can be opened. Click to open it:

- **A file** opens in the editor. A position after it, as compilers, test
  runners and stack traces print it (`src/Main.java:42` or
  `src/Main.java:42:7`), puts the caret on that line and column.
- **A folder** is revealed in the Project tree.
- **A URL** (`http`, `https`, `ftp`, `ftps`, or `mailto`) opens in your browser
  or mail app. A `file://` URL is treated as the path it names.

A relative path is read against the shell's current folder, so a bare name from
`ls` or a path from `grep -n` works as printed. On a host, it is a path on the
host, and the file opens from there. Only a path that exists is
underlined, so ordinary words never turn into links. On a link, the terminal's
right-click menu has **Open Link**, which does the same as the click, and
**Copy Link Address**.

**Hyperlinks programs print** work the same way. Tools such as
`ls --hyperlink`, gcc, and git can mark text as a link to an address of their
choosing (OSC 8 hyperlinks); Ctrl+click opens that address. When the text
isn't the address itself, pointing at it with Ctrl held shows the real address
first. Only `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `mailto` and `file` links open.

A plain click never opens a link: it starts a selection, or goes to a program
such as vim or tmux that reads the mouse.

## Typing over a slow connection

On a slow link to a host, what you type appears at once, dimmed, before the
shell echoes it back, and is replaced by the real echo when it arrives. This is
**type-ahead**. It starts only once echoes take longer than 100 ms, so a shell on
this computer is never affected, and it stays out of full-screen programs such
as vim. Turn it off with **Settings → Terminal → Type-ahead**.

## Run and debug programs in a terminal

Programs that draw on the screen, read single keys or ask for a password need
a real terminal, which the Run and Debug consoles are not. For those:

- A [run configuration](/docs/run-debug#run-configurations)'s **Console:
  Run in a Terminal tab** runs its program in the Terminal tool window. A
  before-launch step still runs in the Run console.
- **Settings → Debugging → Java → Run the program in a Terminal tab instead**
  does the same for a Java or Python program you debug. It needs **Run the
  debugged program in the Debug console (program input)**, beside it, on as
  well (see
  [Program input](/docs/run-debug#program-input-in-the-debug-console)).

The program runs where its configuration or file runs: on this computer, on
the project's host, or in its container or WSL distribution. Its tab is named
after the configuration or file, and the Run tool window's Stop button and
stripe follow it. The configuration's environment variables win over those the
login profile sets, and a working folder that doesn't exist fails the run, as
in the console.

When the program ends, the tab stays, with what it printed and its exit code in
the corner. The next run of the same configuration takes that tab's place
rather than opening another; a run still going keeps its tab. Closing the tab
while the program is still running asks first.

## Colors and font

The terminal takes its colors from the active
[editor theme](/docs/themes-fonts): the theme's keyword color becomes the
terminal's red, its number color the blue, and so on, with the editor's
background and text colors behind and in front. Switching themes recolors
open terminals at once.

The font is always the editor's. **Settings → Terminal → Text size** sets the
terminal's size on its own; 0 keeps the editor's size. Either way the
terminal follows the editor's text zoom.

## Closing a busy terminal

Closing a terminal whose shell is running a program, such as a build or a
server, asks first and names the program. **Cancel** is the default; **Close**
ends the program with the shell. On a host, a container or WSL, Editora asks
that machine which programs the shell is running; when the machine doesn't
answer within a few seconds, the tab closes without asking. A tab running a
program from Run or Debug asks the same way while the program runs.

Closing a window, or quitting Editora, asks once for all the terminals that
are running programs, listing each tab and what it runs. Turn both questions
off with **Settings → Terminal → Ask before closing a terminal that is running
a program**.

## Settings

**Settings → Terminal** (under Languages & Tools):

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell | (blank) | The shell to start on this computer, with any arguments. Blank uses your own shell; see [Where a shell starts](#where-a-shell-starts). |
| Shell integration | On | Start bash and zsh with Editora's [shell integration](#shell-integration). |
| Type-ahead | On | Show typing before a slow shell echoes it; see [Typing over a slow connection](#typing-over-a-slow-connection). |
| Open Terminal Here uses the system terminal | Off | Off: [Open Terminal Here](#open-terminal-here) opens a tab in the Terminal tool window. On: it starts your system's terminal application. |
| Text size | 0 | The terminal's text size, 6 to 72. 0 uses the editor's size. |
| Cursor | Block | Block, Underline, or Bar. |
| Flash on the bell character | On | Flash the terminal when a program rings the bell, and mark its tab when it is out of sight. |
| Scrollback lines | 5,000 | Lines of history kept above the screen, up to 50,000. Each terminal can use about 1 MB per 1,000 lines. |
| Commands that reach Editora | `tool.*, palette.show, search.everywhere, terminal.*` | See [Keys](#keys). |
| Option key as Meta (macOS) | Off | On: Option+key is the shell's Meta key. Off: Option types your layout's characters. See [Alt and Option](#alt-and-option). |
| Confirm a paste of several lines | On | Ask before pasting several lines into a program that would run each at once; see [Copy and paste](#copy-and-paste). |
| Ask before closing a terminal that is running a program | On | See [Closing a busy terminal](#closing-a-busy-terminal). |

Text size, cursor, bell, type-ahead, the command list, the Option key, the
paste question and the close question apply to open terminals. Shell, shell
integration, and scrollback apply from the next terminal you open.

## Known limitations

- **Prompts built for dark terminals are hard to read on light themes.** Some
  prompt themes, such as Oh My Bash's *agnoster*, draw text in the default
  color on a black segment, which is dark on dark under a light editor theme.
  No terminal palette fixes that; use a prompt theme that suits light
  backgrounds, or a dark editor theme.
- Without [shell integration](#shell-integration) (another shell, or the
  setting off), Editora reads a shell's current folder on Linux and macOS only.
  On Windows, tab titles then don't follow the folder, and only absolute paths
  and URLs in the output become links, not relative paths. A terminal on a host
  needs shell integration for the folder at all.
- macOS's own `/bin/bash` is version 3.2, which can't mark where a command's
  output starts: Copy Last Command Output needs zsh or bash 4.4 or later.
- Find matches within one line of the screen. Text that wrapped onto the next
  line is two lines to it.
- Shells don't outlive Editora: a Terminal open again at the next start has new
  shells, without the old ones' output.
