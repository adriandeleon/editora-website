## Doctor

**`View: Doctor`** (in the Tools menu and the command palette, linked from the
Welcome page and from the message log's **Open Doctor** button) opens a full-tab
health report of every external command Editora's features rely on, in the
spirit of `flutter doctor`. It covers Git and the GitHub CLI (including whether
`gh` is signed in), ripgrep, GnuPG and its passphrase prompt for encrypted
files, the preview and diagram tools (`mmdc`, `maid`, Graphviz, PlantUML, the
Typst CLI), every enabled language server, the Python formatter, ShellCheck and
shfmt, the debug adapters (java-debug, debugpy, js-debug), the Run interpreters
(with a JDK 25 check for Java, and the Python interpreter and Node.js that Run,
Debug and the language servers share), the Node.js for HTTP scripts, the build
tools, the AI provider and agent, the container engine (and WSL on Windows),
elevated save, browsers, the in-app installer's prerequisites, and plugins that
failed to load or start.

A missing tool is a problem only when the window needs it: a file of that
language is open, the project has the tool's marker file, or you set its command.
Anything else shows as **Not installed** and is not counted. Problems and warnings
are gathered under **Needs attention** at the top; sections where everything is
OK fold to one line.

Each row shows the resolved command and its version or path. When something is
off, the row carries a plain-language tip and its fix: **Install…** (the in-app
installer), **Turn on** for a switched-off feature, **How to install**, and
**Settings…** straight to the right page. All probes run off the UI thread, and
only when you open or refresh the screen.

Start here when something that should work doesn't: it answers "is the tool
installed, is it the version I think, and is Editora looking at the right one" in
one pass. **Copy Report** puts the whole report on the clipboard, ready to paste
into a bug report.

Under the XML language server, the **XML schema cache** row shows how much the
server has downloaded (the schemas and DTDs XML files name) and where it keeps
it, `cache/lemminx` in Editora's config folder, with a **Clear** button. With
the XML server off, the row sits under the Maven `pom.xml` server instead, and
either way it follows its server into **Needs attention**. Under the Maven
server, the **lemminx-maven artifact store** row shows the size of the
`.lemminx-maven` folder where lemminx-maven keeps what it resolves (beside your
local Maven repository: `~/.m2/.lemminx-maven`, or next to the folder
`<localRepository>` names in `~/.m2/settings.xml`), with
**Clear**, and **Reveal in File Manager** in its right-click menu. A language
server that keeps crashing, or fails its requests, is a warning with an
**Install…** button that installs it again and a **Restart Language Servers**
button; the same goes for a server this window stopped restarting after it
kept crashing, and for a Node.js server (bash-language-server, Pyright, the
JSON, YAML and other npm servers) when no `node` is found. The rows of
npm-installed servers show the installed package version. A language server
that exits as soon as it starts shows what it printed, rather than *OK*; for lemminx on a Linux older than glibc 2.34, see
[Installing lemminx](/docs/lsp#installing-lemminx). A server that keeps
failing while it runs a command you set in Settings gets no **Install…**,
since installing would not change that command: its tip says to fix the
command or clear it to use the default, then run **Restart Language Servers**.

The **HTML** row warns when the copy of vscode-langservers-extracted in use
cannot load TypeScript's libraries, which is the case for any copy installed
with npm on its own: JavaScript in `<script>` then has no DOM or standard
library, nothing completes after `document.` and there is no parameter help.
**Update** installs Editora's own copy, which has them, and a blank HTML
command uses it. When the HTML command is your own, the tip says to install the
HTML server and clear the command. See [Installing it](/docs/html#installing-it).

The **Node.js** row counts the open npm-installed servers (HTML, CSS, JSON,
YAML, Bash, Pyright…) as needing Node.js, not only JavaScript and TypeScript.
When it is missing and one of them needs it, the tip names that server and
says to install Node.js or choose one in **Settings → Debugging →
JavaScript**.

### Update… for servers older than Editora's

Editora installs some servers and tools at the exact release it is tested with:
jdtls (Java), the JavaScript debugger (js-debug), lemminx (XML), the Maven
`pom.xml` server (lemminx-maven), gls (Groovy), Metals (Scala), the Kotlin server, clojure-lsp,
bash-language-server, vscode-langservers-extracted (the HTML, CSS and JSON
servers), ShellCheck and shfmt. A newer Editora can move to a newer release of one of
them. When the copy you have is older than the one this Editora is tested with,
its Doctor row is a warning that names both versions, and its **Install…**
button reads **Update…**.

**Update…** downloads the release Editora is tested with, replaces the old copy,
and restarts the server on it. If the download fails, the server starts again on
the old copy. Install… in Settings also replaces Editora's own copy when it is
known to be older.

What the warning says depends on whose copy it is:

- **Editora installed it.** For example *Editora installed 0.10.0; this release
  of Editora is tested with 0.11.0.* Update replaces it.
- **Installed by an earlier Editora.** Editora now records the version of each
  copy it installs. For a copy from before that, Doctor reads the version from
  its files, or from what the program prints, where it can. Where it can't tell
  (a Kotlin server from an earlier Editora, for example), the row says the copy
  may be older and offers Update, which installs the tested release.
- **Your own copy is older.** A language server you installed yourself, or a
  ShellCheck or shfmt found on your `PATH`: Update installs Editora's own copy
  and uses it instead, and your copy stays where it is. Doctor warns about your
  own copy only when it can tell its version; otherwise the row stays OK.
- **A ShellCheck or shfmt path set in Settings.** You get the warning but no
  Update, since Settings names that copy on purpose. Update that copy yourself,
  or clear the path in **Settings → LSP** to use Editora's own.

bash-language-server is a global npm package, not a copy in Editora's folder.
Its row warns when it is older than 5.7, the oldest release that works well
with Editora, and Update installs the tested 5.8.1.

vscode-langservers-extracted is installed with npm into `plugins/lsp/web` in
Editora's config folder, at 4.10.0. For a copy of your own, Doctor reads the
version from its `package.json`.

### Check for Newer Versions

Many other servers and tools Editora installs at their latest release, so there
is no tested version to compare with. **Check for Newer Versions**, in Doctor's
header, asks where each one is published (npm, the Go module proxy, GitHub and
HashiCorp) for its latest release. It covers Pyright,
typescript-language-server, the YAML, Dockerfile, TOML
and Astro servers, gopls, clangd, lua-language-server, tinymist, terraform-ls
and the Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`), and only the ones that are installed and working.

Nothing is looked up until you click the button: opening Doctor or clicking
**Refresh** never asks for newer versions. The status bar then says what the
check found: newer releases for some of your language servers and tools, that
they are all on their latest releases, or that some could not be checked (when
you are offline, for example).

A row with a newer release moves to **Updates available**, below **Needs
attention**, and the summary links to it. The row stays OK, says which version
is installed and which is the latest release, and has an **Update…** button
that installs the latest release. Editora keeps what the check found until you
close the window, so a Refresh still shows the group.

The pinned servers and tools [above](#update-for-servers-older-than-editoras)
are never looked up: a new Editora release brings their newer versions, and
**Update…** on their rows installs them. Servers that a toolchain keeps up to
date, such as rust-analyzer through rustup, are not looked up either.

## A launcher is blocked on first run

Installers are currently unsigned, so the operating system stops the first
launch until you allow it. You only do this once.

- **macOS** (15 and later): open Editora once and dismiss the warning, then go
  to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the Security section,
  and click **Open Anyway** next to the Editora message. Confirm, and it
  launches normally from then on. On macOS 14 and earlier, Control-click the app
  in Finder and choose *Open* instead.
- **Windows**: in the SmartScreen dialog, click **More info**, then **Run
  anyway**.

## External tools aren't found

Language servers, debug adapters, `git`, `mmdc`, and the file runner are
external programs Editora launches. A GUI-launched app inherits a stripped
`PATH` that often misses Homebrew, npm, and version-manager directories, so a
tool that works in your terminal may look "not found" in the app.

Editora rebuilds the `PATH` from your login shell plus the usual install
locations before launching anything, which recovers most setups (including
nvm/fnm/asdf per-version bins). A Python environment you activated before
starting Editora (`$VIRTUAL_ENV`, `$CONDA_PREFIX`) stays first on that `PATH`.
If a tool still isn't found:

- Set its absolute path in the relevant Settings page (LSP, Debugging, Mermaid).
- Confirm it runs from a plain login shell, since that's the `PATH` Editora reads.
- On Windows there's no login-shell convention, so prefer setting absolute paths.

## A language server starts but does nothing

The status bar shows an **LSP: \<server\>** segment and a loading bar while a
server initializes. If it never settles, restart servers with *LSP: Restart
Language Servers* (`lsp.restartServers`). For Java specifically, a stale `jdtls` process from a
previous run can hold its workspace lock; the loading bar clearing is the sign
the handshake completed. A server that starts but then fails its requests is
announced in the status bar (`lemminx-maven: internal error on hover — see the
log`), stopped after three failures in a row, and shown as a warning in Doctor,
with **Install…** for a server Editora installs;
the Maven `pom.xml` server whose folder is missing jars is reported as
*incomplete* in Settings → LSP and Doctor, and its **Install…** repairs it.

A server whose requests time out twice in a row is reported once, with its
name: *Not responding: its requests time out. Run “Restart Language Servers” to
start it again.* When it answers again, the status bar says *Responding again*.

**Format Document** says why it changed nothing. *Already formatted* means the
server answered with no edits. Otherwise it says *Format failed: the language
server did not answer in time*, *Format failed: the language server stopped
before it answered*, or *Format failed:* with the server's own error.

## JavaScript in an HTML page completes nothing

If completion after `document.` in a `<script>` offers nothing and there is no
parameter help, the HTML server cannot find TypeScript's libraries (its log
says *Unable to load library*). That happens with a copy of
vscode-langservers-extracted installed with npm on its own, such as
`npm install -g`. Doctor's HTML row says so: click **Update**, or **Install…**
on the HTML card in Settings → LSP, to install Editora's own copy, and leave
the HTML command blank so it is used. See
[Installing it](/docs/html#installing-it).

## Language servers run the wrong Node.js

The Node.js chosen in **Settings → Debugging → JavaScript** (the **Node.js**
row) runs every language server installed with npm, not only TypeScript's: the
HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML and Bash servers, Pyright and the others. Left blank,
Editora uses the version a project's `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` names (from
nvm), else `node` on the `PATH`. A server row that would warn about a missing
Node.js does not, when that setting names one that exists.

## Python imports show as errors

`Import "requests" could not be resolved` on a package you have installed
means Pyright is looking at a different Python than the one the package is in.

- Look at the interpreter item in the status bar, for example
  `Python 3.13.5 (PATH)`. `(PATH)` means no project environment was found.
- Click it, or run **Python: Select Interpreter** (`python.selectInterpreter`),
  and pick the project's environment, or **Browse…** to the environment's
  `python`. The server picks the change up at once.
- An environment named something other than `.venv`, `venv`, `env` or `.env`, or
  one outside the project, is not found by itself: pick it once, and the project
  keeps it.
- A `pyrightconfig.json` or `[tool.pyright]` section that sets `venv` wins over
  the pick inside Pyright.
- Doctor's **Python interpreter** row shows the same interpreter, its version
  and why it was chosen.

See [the Python interpreter](/docs/lsp#the-python-interpreter).

## A project's tools don't run in its container

A project's tools [run in a container](/docs/remote#tools-in-a-container) only
when all of these hold:

- **Run commands on the remote host** is on in Settings → Remote.
- The container is running, and one of its bind mounts covers the project
  folder. A dev container is found only when the project folder itself has a
  `.devcontainer` folder or a `.devcontainer.json` file.
- You allowed that container. **Not Now** holds until you restart Editora, and
  so does going back with *Containers: Run This Project's Tools Here*. Picking
  the container with *Containers: Run This Project's Tools in a Container…*
  allows it at once.

Editora looks for a dev container when the project opens and when its window
comes back to the front, at most every 30 seconds, so one started meanwhile is
picked up once you switch back to the window. If the picker says no containers
are running, check that the **Container engine** in Settings → Remote names the
engine you use (`docker` or `podman`) and that it lists your container in a
terminal.

A debug session that cannot reach its port in the container or WSL distribution
needs `nc`, `bash` or `python3` in it; see
[Ports and debuggers](/docs/remote#ports-and-debuggers).

## A WSL project misses outside changes

Windows cannot watch a folder on the `\\wsl.localhost` share. Editora watches a
WSL project from inside the distribution, but only while the project's
[tools run there](/docs/remote#tools-in-wsl-windows). Allow the distribution
when asked, and install `inotify-tools` in it for changes to show at once
rather than within a few seconds. See
[Outside changes in WSL](/docs/remote#outside-changes-in-wsl).

## Shell scripts show no problems or don't format

The Bash language server needs two helper programs: **ShellCheck** for
diagnostics and **shfmt** for Format Document. Without them a script looks
clean and Format Document changes nothing. A banner above the script says so,
with **Install**, and the **Bash / Shell** card in **Settings → LSP** and the
Doctor show whether each is found. Install them with the Install… buttons
there, or with **Install: ShellCheck and shfmt** (`install.shellTools`) in the
palette. If you turned **Lint with ShellCheck** or **Format with shfmt** off on
the Bash / Shell card, turn it back on. See [ShellCheck and shfmt](/docs/lsp#shellcheck-and-shfmt).

If ShellCheck runs but ignores a `.shellcheckrc`, the file is probably in a
subfolder of the project; ShellCheck reads it only from the project folder or
above. See [Where ShellCheck finds .shellcheckrc](/docs/lsp#where-shellcheck-finds-shellcheckrc).

A script whose ShellCheck problems seem to be missing, while others show
theirs, may be a zsh script: ShellCheck cannot check zsh, and the problem
counter says **Not checked**. A `PKGBUILD` shows no SC2034 or SC2154 by design.

The server's own warnings, such as a helper it could not find, are in the
Debug Log (below).

## Seeing errors in a packaged build

A packaged app has no visible console. Editora captures its logging and uncaught
exceptions into a **Debug Log**:

- Open it with **Settings → Advanced → Show Debug Log…** or `view.debugLog`.
- It also mirrors to `editora-session.log` in your config folder, so it survives
  a crash for a bug report. The session before keeps its file as
  `editora-session.prev.log`, so reopening Editora after a crash does not erase
  the log that recorded it. Neither file goes into a configuration export.

The **message log** (click the status-bar message, or `view.messageLog`) keeps a
session history of the transient status-bar messages.

## Reporting a problem

**Help → Report a Problem…** (`help.reportProblem`, also a button in the Debug
Log window) prepares a bug report from the Debug Log of this session and the one
before. It also lists Editora's version, the Java it runs on, your operating
system and your plugins. Before you see it, Editora replaces what looks private:
paths in your home folder, your user name, e-mail addresses, credentials in URLs,
authentication headers and values shaped like tokens. The window says how many it
replaced.

The report is shown, and you can edit it, before anything leaves your computer.
Editora sends nothing by itself:

- **Open GitHub Issue** copies the report and opens a new issue in your browser
  with it filled in. A report too long for the link is left on your clipboard
  instead, for you to paste into the issue's *Problem report* box. Describe what
  happened, then submit the issue yourself.
- **Copy** and **Save…** are there for any other way of sending it.

The issue is public, so read the report first and delete anything you would
rather not share.

When Editora will not start, run `editora --report` instead (see
[command-line flags](/docs/cli#flags)). It writes the same report to the current
folder, prints its path and the link of a new issue, and opens both.

## After a crash or an interrupted save

- **Unsaved edits.** If Editora did not close normally (a crash, a kill, a
  logout, a power cut), the next launch opens **Recover Unsaved Edits** with the
  text of every tab that had unsaved changes. See
  [crash recovery](/docs/undo-history#crash-recovery). Reopen the list any time
  with `file.recoverUnsavedEdits`.
- **A save that did not finish.** Some files are overwritten in place rather
  than replaced. While that happens their previous contents are held in
  `save-backups/` in the config folder. If Editora stops in the middle, the next
  launch shows an **Unfinished Save** dialog that names the backup and offers
  **Restore Previous Contents**, **Keep Current File**, or **Decide Later**.
  Keep Current File deletes the backup. When the file itself is gone, the
  backup is the only copy left and that button reads **Delete Backup**.
- **Save as Administrator.** The file is backed up beside itself
  (`<name>.editora-backup`) before it is overwritten, and put back if the write
  fails. If it cannot be put back either, the status bar names the backup, and
  the next administrator save of that file is refused until you restore or
  remove it.
- **A refactoring that moves or deletes files.** If Editora is interrupted in
  the middle of one, opening the project again shows an **Interrupted
  Refactoring** dialog that lists the files that were moved aside and offers to
  put them back.
- **A damaged config file.** A config file that is empty or unreadable at
  startup is copied to `<name>.corrupt.bak` and reported in the status bar
  rather than reset silently. See
  [Configuration](/docs/configuration#safety-copies).

## Two editors show different settings

Two Editora processes on the same config folder (the second started with
`--new-instance`) do not overwrite each other's data, but each one reads the
other's changes only when it starts. Restart the one that looks stale. See
[Configuration](/docs/configuration#two-editors-on-one-config-folder).

## Settings sync shows "Sync ⚠"

The status-bar segment means the last automatic sync failed; click it to open
**Settings → Sync**, where the Status row gives the reason. Automatic syncs
never prompt for credentials, so a repository that needs a password or an SSH
passphrase fails until a credential helper or an SSH agent can supply it. Run
**Settings Sync: Sync Now** (`sync.now`) to try with your credential helper. See
[Settings sync](/docs/settings-sync#credentials-and-failures).

## A file shows the wrong characters

Editora reads a file as UTF-8 unless a byte-order mark or an `.editorconfig`
`charset` rule says otherwise. A file in some other encoding still opens without
losing any bytes, but its accented or non-Latin text can look garbled, and the
encoding in the status bar is drawn in the warning colour. Click it and choose **Reopen with Encoding…** with the file's
real encoding (Shift_JIS, windows-1251, GBK and so on). Editora remembers the
choice for that file. See [File encodings](/docs/workspace#file-encodings).

## Performance

Editora aims to stay responsive on large files. Highlighting and the minimap
turn off automatically at about 5 MB; the status line then lists everything a
large file opens without (highlighting, folding, Structure, spell check, the
minimap, undo and the language server), and the Structure window says why it is
empty. Files of about 50 MB open read-only
with a capped load. A file of 5 MB or more that would not fit in the memory that
is left (typically a second or third very large file) opens the same way, as a
read-only slice of its first part; close other large tabs and reopen it to edit
it. Lines longer than 20,000 characters are not syntax-highlighted, though the
rest of the file is. A file with a line of 10,000 characters or a long run
without spaces (minified code, an embedded image) opens unwrapped even where
[word wrap](/docs/editing#word-wrap) is on; *View: Toggle Word Wrap* wraps it
anyway. Find in a very large file searches in the background and
holds at most 100,000 matches around the current one, so the count can read
"N of 100,000+"; Next, Previous, Replace, and Replace All still reach every
match. If editing or scrolling feels heavy:

- Check whether a language server is busy (the LSP loading bar).
- Try **Simple UI mode** (`view.toggleSimpleMode`), which drops the gutter,
  minimap, and the heavier features.
- The native builds set conservative heap and GC options and bake in an AOT
  class cache for faster startup; a missing cache just falls back to a normal
  start.

## Reset or isolate your config

- **Reset to Defaults** in **Settings → Advanced** resets every preference,
  including the keymap choice, which goes back to Emacs. Text zoom is kept, and
  your key rebinds stay stored with the keymap you made them in, so they apply
  again when you switch back to it.
  The previous preferences are first saved as
  `settings.json.before-reset-<date>.bak` in the config folder, and the status
  bar names the file; copy it back over `settings.json` while Editora is closed
  to undo the reset.
- **Export Configuration…** zips the active config folder for a backup or bug
  report.
- Run with `--dev` or `--config-dir <path>` to use a separate config without
  touching your everyday one. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) and the
  [command-line reference](/docs/cli).

## Editora 0.13.0 quits instantly on startup

If you are on **0.13.0**, upgrade to **0.13.1** or later. 0.13.0 crashed a
fraction of a second into startup, intermittently, on any CPU without AVX-512
(most consumer Intel from the 12th generation onward, and every AMD before
Zen 4). It is fixed in 0.13.1, and there is no workaround worth applying on the
old build.

If you are still stuck, [report a problem](#reporting-a-problem): the report
carries the Debug Log, redacted.
