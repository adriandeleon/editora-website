## Syntax highlighting

Highlighting uses **TextMate grammars** through tm4e. When you open a file,
Editora maps its extension (or, for a `Dockerfile`, its name) to a bundled
grammar and tokenizes the document line by line. Tokenization is **stateful**,
so block comments and heredocs highlight correctly across lines, and
**incremental**, so an edit re-tokenizes only from the changed line, off the UI
thread. Token colors come from the active editor theme.

Files without a bundled grammar are left unstyled rather than guessed at.

### Supported languages

Grammars ship for Java, Astro, XML, shell, PowerShell, DOS batch, Python, Groovy,
Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, Ruby, C, C++, Rust, Go, C#, Markdown, JSON, CSS, HTML,
YAML, INI, SQL, TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, Lua, Dockerfile, Terraform, TOML,
Mermaid, and the HTTP request format. The TypeScript grammar also covers plain
JavaScript.

XML covers its dialects too: DTDs (`.dtd`, `.ent`, `.mod`), RELAX NG,
XSL-FO, Schematron, MSBuild and NuGet project files, `.resx`, XAML, XLIFF,
property lists, KML, GPX, DITA and others open as XML (the full list is under
[XML](/docs/lsp#xml)). DTD declarations (`<!ELEMENT>`, `<!ATTLIST>`,
`<!NOTATION>`, like `<!ENTITY>`) are highlighted in a DOCTYPE and in a DTD
file. A `go.mod` stays plain text, and `.xhtml` is HTML. A `.mod`, `.sch`,
`.props`, `.targets` or `.fo` file is XML only when its text starts with `<`,
so a Modula-2 module or a KiCad schematic opens as plain text.

The status bar and the Problems window write each language's name as it is
usually written: XML, JSON, YAML, HTML, CSS, SQL, TOML, C++, C#, GraphQL,
PowerShell, and Plain Text for a file with no language.

HTML templates use the HTML grammar: Jinja, Nunjucks, Twig, Liquid, Mustache,
ERB and EJS files open as **HTML Template**, and `.hbs` / `.handlebars` files
as **Handlebars**, with Editora's HTML tag editing, folding and Structure. A
template named after the file it renders (`nginx.conf.j2`, `config.yml.erb`)
opens in that file's language. See [HTML](/docs/html#opening-html-files).

Astro files use the official Astro TextMate grammar, including mixed
frontmatter, HTML, and CSS regions. The same language integration supplies
Structure symbols and can connect to `astro-ls` for code intelligence.

Folding, comment syntax, and auto-indent rules are wired per language alongside
the grammar. Many extension-less dotfiles and named config files (e.g.
`.editorconfig`, `.gitignore` and other `.*ignore` files) are matched by name, so
they get highlighting too (and the matching language server when enabled).

### When the file name says nothing

A file whose name gives no language (an extension-less script, or a `.txt`
file) takes it from its own first lines:

- **A shebang** on the first line: `#!/bin/sh`, `#!/usr/bin/env bash`,
  `#!/usr/bin/env -S bash -e`, `#!/usr/bin/env -u NAME bash`, `#!/bin/busybox sh`,
  and the same for zsh, dash, ksh, mksh, ash and Bats, as well as Python (and
  PyPy), Node, Deno, Bun, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Groovy and PowerShell interpreters,
  and `kotlin`, `scala`, `scala-cli` (`#!/usr/bin/env -S scala-cli shebang`),
  `clojure`, `clj` and Babashka's `bb`. A version or build suffix is ignored
  (`python3.12`, the free-threaded `python3.14t` and `python3-dbg` are Python).
  A Python runner counts too: `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` (a script
  with inline dependencies), `pipx run`, and `poetry`, `pdm`, `hatch`, `rye` or
  `pipenv` running `python`. A `java` shebang counts when a `--source N` follows
  it (`#!/usr/bin/env -S java --source 25`).
- **A modeline**, when there is no shebang Editora knows: a vim modeline in the
  first or last five lines (`# vim: ft=sh`, `# vim: set filetype=bash :`), or an
  emacs line on the first line, or the second after a shebang
  (`# -*- mode: sh -*-`, `# -*- sh -*-`).
- **An XML declaration**, when neither of those names a language: a file that
  starts with `<?xml` (an `AndroidManifest`, say) is XML. A `.txt` or `.text`
  file is never read as XML this way.
- **An HTML start**, when none of those names a language: a file that starts
  with `<!doctype html` or an `<html>` tag, in either case, after any blank
  lines and `<!-- -->` comments, is HTML (a saved page, CGI output). A `.txt`
  or `.text` file stays plain text.

A shebang typed into a new or extension-less file switches the language once you
stop typing. An extension or name that gives a language always wins over both.

To set the language yourself, click the language in the status bar, or run
**Buffer: Set Language…** (`buffer.setLanguage`). The choice applies at once to
everything that depends on the language: highlighting, comment syntax, the
status bar, the tab's file-type icon, the [language server](/docs/lsp), and the
Run ▶ for scripts. It lasts while the file stays open.

### Java scripts

A Java file without a `.java` name, such as an extension-less
`java --source 25` shebang script or a file set to Java in the status bar, is
served by the [Java language server](/docs/lsp) when it is set up, like a `.java`
file: completion, hover, the outline and syntax errors.
A completion that adds an import puts it below the `#!` line, so the script
still runs. The server sees the script on its own, outside any project, so it
reports syntax errors but not type errors, as for any `.java` file outside a
project. This works for scripts on this machine, not for one in a
[remote folder](/docs/remote). See [Run & debug](/docs/run-debug) for running
and debugging one.

### Scala and Clojure

**Scala** files are `.scala`, Scala CLI and Ammonite scripts (`.sc`), sbt builds
(`.sbt`) and Mill builds (`.mill`). Scala 3's optional braces are understood:
Enter indents after a line that opens a block (`class Shelf:`, `def f =`,
`case x =>`, `if … then`, `for … do`, `match`, `else`), and such a block folds
from its first line to the end of its indentation, through its `end` marker when
it has one. Brace-style Scala 2 code folds on its braces, and a `'symbol`
literal is not read as the start of a string.

**Clojure** files are `.clj`, ClojureScript `.cljs`, shared `.cljc` (and the
older `.cljx`), EDN data (`.edn`, including `deps.edn` and `bb.edn`), Babashka
scripts (`.bb`) and Leiningen's project.clj.

- Comment toggling uses `;;`.
- Enter and Tab indent the way Clojure is written: a call's arguments line up
  under its first argument, the body of a definition or binding form (`defn`,
  `let`, `when`, `ns`, `with-…` and the like) sits two spaces in, and the
  elements of a vector or map line up after the bracket. Tab sets a line to that
  indent exactly, pulling back a line that is too deep.
- Every form that spans lines folds. Brackets inside strings, comments,
  character literals (`\(`) and regexes (`#"…"`) are skipped.
- Typing `'` or a backtick inserts just that character: they are Clojure's
  quote, not string delimiters.
- The Structure panel lists the namespace and the top-level `def`, `defn`,
  `defmacro`, `defmulti`, `deftest`, `defprotocol` and `defrecord` forms, with a
  function's parameter vector beside its name.

Both languages have snippets, file icons, [Go to Symbol](/docs/code-navigation)
without a language server, and entries in the Project tree's **New ▸** menu:
**Scala** and **Clojure** under Languages, **Scala CLI** and **Babashka** under
Scripts.

### Shell scripts

These open as shell scripts (bash, zsh, ksh and POSIX sh share one grammar):

- **Extensions:** `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.ksh`, `.mksh`, `.command`, `.bats`,
  `.ebuild`, `.eclass`, and names ending in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or `.profile`.
- **Startup files**, such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.bash_login`,
  `.bash_logout`, `.bash_aliases`, `.profile`, `.zshrc`, `.zshenv`, `.zprofile`,
  `.zlogin`, `.zlogout`, `.kshrc`, `.mkshrc`, `.xinitrc`, `.xprofile`,
  `.xsession`, `.bashrc.local` and `.zshrc.local`, plus direnv's `.envrc`.
- **System copies:** `/etc/profile`, `/etc/bashrc`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`,
  `/etc/zshrc` and the files in `/etc/zsh/`.
- **Other names:** the `mvnw` and `gradlew` build wrappers, `PKGBUILD` and
  `APKBUILD` package recipes, and bash-completion scripts (anything in a
  `bash-completion/completions` or `bash_completion.d` folder).
- Any file with a shell shebang or modeline, as above, or a
  `# shellcheck shell=bash` (or `sh`, `dash`, `ksh`, `zsh`) line in its first
  20 lines, such as a sourced `.inc` file.

The shell grammar is the one VS Code uses, with Editora's own fixes. Commands,
keywords, variables, quoted strings, here-doc text and comments are coloured; a
command's bare arguments and options are plain text. Here-docs end at their
delimiter in every form (`<<EOF`, `<<-EOF`, `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`, `<<\EOF`),
`$(( … ))` is coloured as arithmetic, the right side of `[[ … =~ … ]]` as a
regular expression, and the `)` that ends a `case` pattern is not counted by
bracket-pair colorization. zsh files use the same grammar, so zsh-only syntax
such as `${(k)map}` stays plain.

zsh startup files (`.zshrc`, `.zprofile`, `/etc/zsh/zshenv` and the like) are
not opened on the Bash language server: nothing in them says they are zsh, so it
would check them as bash and report valid zsh as errors. `.zsh` scripts stay on
the server. See [Language servers](/docs/lsp) for the Bash server, and
[Run & debug](/docs/run-debug) for running scripts.

### Python

`.py`, `.pyw` and `.pyi` files open as Python, and so does any file with a
Python shebang or modeline (see above). The grammar covers current Python:
f-strings with nested quotes and format specs (`f"{when:%Y-%m-%d}"`), t-strings
(`t"Hi {name}"`), `match` and `case` statements (a `match` used as a plain name
or call stays a name), type parameters (`def first[T](items: list[T])`,
`class Box[T]:`) and the `type` alias statement. A name after `def` or `class`
is coloured as a declaration, including `__init__` and a method named like a
builtin (`def open`), and decorators such as `@property` read as decorators.
Number prefixes and suffixes (`0x`, `0b`, `3j`) are part of the number.

Without a [language server](/docs/lsp), Python files still fold by indentation
and get sticky scroll (see [Editing](/docs/editing#python)), the Structure tool
window lists classes, functions and methods nested by indentation, and
[Go to Symbol in Project](/docs/code-navigation#go-to-symbol-in-project) finds
them across the project.

The other files of a Python project open with a format too:

- **pip requirements:** `requirements.txt` and its variants
  (`requirements-dev.txt`, `dev-requirements.txt`, `requirements.in`,
  `constraints.txt`, files ending in `.pip`, and any `.txt` or `.in` file in a
  `requirements` folder). Package names, extras, version specifiers,
  environment markers, the `-r`, `-c` and `-e` options and URLs are coloured,
  Toggle Comment uses `#`, and only comments are spell-checked.
- **TOML:** `Pipfile`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock` and `pdm.lock`.
- **JSON:** `Pipfile.lock` and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). A notebook opens as
  its JSON text; there is no notebook view.

## Autocomplete

Completion appears as you type, debounced and kept off the hot path. Java member
completion triggers immediately after `.`, while identifier completion begins
after a short pause. Other word completion won't trigger below a two-character
prefix.

- **Code buffers** get a popup that merges sources and ranks them: language-server
  results (when [LSP](/docs/lsp) is on), then snippets.
  Press **Enter** or **Tab** to accept. Complete result lists filter locally and
  obsolete server requests are cancelled as you keep typing. Accepting a snippet
  starts a tab-stop session; accepting a Java LSP item can safely add its import
  after continued typing, grouped with the completion as one undo/redo action.
- **Prose buffers** (plain text and Markdown) get inline **ghost text**, a muted
  suffix you accept with **Tab**.

Trigger manually with `C-M-i` or `M-/`. Completion also fires on a language
server's advertised trigger characters, so `<` in HTML or `:` in CSS pops the
popup. In the popup, **Up** / **Down** and `C-n` / `C-p` move the selection, and
**Esc** or `C-g` dismisses it.

The code popup is IntelliJ-style: per-kind icons (class, method, keyword,
snippet, and so on), the matched characters highlighted, deprecated items struck
through, and a **documentation popup** beside the list. The docs popup shows
automatically and toggles with `C-q` (*Edit: Toggle Completion Documentation*).

Toggles live in **Settings → Code Completion**: a master switch plus per-source switches
for words (prose), snippets, and Mermaid keywords. Palette equivalents are
`view.toggleAutocomplete` and the per-source variants.

## Spell checking

Misspelled words get a red wavy underline. Right-click for **suggestions** (pick
one to replace), **Add to Dictionary**, or **Ignore**. **Ignore** stops flagging
the word in every open file until Editora is closed; **Add to Dictionary** keeps
it for good.

What is checked depends on the file type:

- **Plain text and Markdown** are checked in full, apart from inline code and
  link addresses; in Markdown, fenced code blocks, front matter, link
  definitions, HTML tags and lint directives are skipped too, while link text
  and image alt text are checked.
- **HTML** (and HTML templates) has the text visitors read checked, plus
  comments and the `alt`, `title`, `placeholder`, `aria-label` and
  `aria-description` values. Tags, other attributes and the content of
  `<script>`, `<style>`, `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>` and `<var>` are
  left alone; the rest of a line that holds an inline `<script>` is still
  checked. See [HTML](/docs/html#spell-checking).
- **Typst** has the document's text checked, plus comments. Typst math and
  lines that open with a `#` instruction are left alone.
- **Source code** has only comments and string literals checked, so identifiers
  aren't flagged. In shell scripts a command's bare arguments and options
  (`pipefail`, package names, `-xzf`) are not checked; quoted strings, here-doc
  text and comments are. In Python the first word of a prefixed string
  (`f"…"`, `rb'…'`) is checked like the rest, without its prefix, and in a pip
  requirements file only the comments are checked.
- **Data and configuration formats** are off by default: JSON, YAML, TOML, XML,
  CSV, INI, properties, `.env`, Git and SSH configuration, system configuration
  files, logs, and diffs.

**Settings → Spell Check → File Types** has a tick box per file type, and **Spell
Check: Toggle for This File Type** (`spell.toggleForLanguage`) flips the active
file's type. `view.toggleSpellCheck` turns checking on or off everywhere.

### Spell-check commands

Everything on the right-click menu is also a command, so you can work through a
file from the keyboard.

| Action | Command | Emacs key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Next misspelling | `spell.nextMisspelling` | (palette) |
| Previous misspelling | `spell.previousMisspelling` | (palette) |
| Correct the word at the caret | `spell.correctWord` | `M-S-4` (`M-$`) |
| Add the word at the caret to the dictionary | `spell.addWord` | (palette) |
| Ignore the word at the caret | `spell.ignoreWord` | (palette) |
| Set the file's dictionary | `spell.setLanguage` | (palette) |
| Reload the personal dictionary | `spell.reloadDictionary` | (palette) |

**Correct Word at Caret** opens a list of suggestions to filter and pick from.
The other keymaps bind the navigation keys: in **CUA**, `F7` and `Shift+F7` go to
the next and previous misspelling; in **Sublime Text**, `F6` toggles spell check
and `Ctrl+F6` / `Ctrl+Shift+F6` go to the next and previous misspelling.

### Dictionaries

Spell check uses Apache Lucene's pure-Java **Hunspell** engine, with no native
dependency. English (US and UK), Spanish (Spain and Mexico), and French ship in
the app. The default dictionary is set in **Settings → Spell Check**. The status
bar shows the dictionary the active file is checked with; click it, or run
**Spell Check: Set Language…**, to give the file another one. The picker lists
the languages by name, marks the current one, and has an entry that returns the
file to the default.

Words you add live in `dictionary.txt` in your config folder. **Settings → Spell
Check** has an editor for the list (`spell.manageDictionary`) and a switch that
turns the personal dictionary off. After editing `dictionary.txt` outside
Settings, run **Spell Check: Reload Personal Dictionary**.

A bundled **technical-terms dictionary** (`config`, `async`, `middleware`,
`kubernetes`, and the like, plus common Python words such as `kwargs`,
`asyncio`, `argparse` and `noqa`) keeps code-adjacent words from being flagged
in any language; toggle it in Settings or with `view.toggleTechnicalDictionary`.
Its over 2,000 terms cover Git (`worktree`, `unstaged`, `rebasing`), editor and
UI words (`submenu`, `breakpoint`, `monospace`), shell tools (`ripgrep`, `fzf`),
Unix and C (`inode`, `glibc`, `malloc`), cryptography, fonts and graphics
(`harfbuzz`, `grayscale`), the Java toolchain (`jlink`, `jpackage`), language
servers, web, devops and AI names, the -ed and -ing forms of the words it lists
(`deserialized`, `symlinking`), and British spellings (`tokenised`). It leaves
out short words a typo could make, such as "nat" for "not" or "elt" for "let".

A word's possessive is accepted when the word itself is: "someone else's" and
"another's" pass because the dictionary spells "else" and "another". A word in
your personal dictionary or the technical dictionary also accepts its plural
(`configs`, `regexes`), so only list the base form.
