This page covers two parts of moving around code. **Reach** is whether the
thing can be found at all, which the server-free symbol index handles. **Flow**
is whether you can jump without losing your place, which the peek, preview and
related-file commands handle.

For pickers, find, and project-wide search, see
[Navigation & search](/docs/navigation).

## Go to Symbol in Project

**Go to Symbol in Project** (`index.gotoSymbol`) finds a class, method or
function anywhere in the project **with no language server installed**. Editora
carries its own declaration scanner, so the command works on a first run and in
every language that ships a grammar but has no server.

Sixteen language ids are covered: Java, Kotlin, C#, Python, JavaScript,
JSX, TypeScript, TSX, Go, Rust, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, shell and Lua. It records
the kinds of symbol a pattern can identify reliably: type, interface, enum,
method, function, field, variable and module. LSP has twenty-six kinds, and most
of them need real type resolution to tell apart.

The same index backs the file and symbol halves of
[Search Everywhere](/docs/navigation#search-everywhere) and
[Go to Related File](#go-to-related-file).

### It is built lazily

The index is **not** built when a project opens, because walking every file is
wasted work if you never ask for a symbol. The first query does the walk. It
takes under a second on a 650-file project and is announced in the status bar so
it doesn't look like a hang. After that the index is incremental: saving a file
rescans only that file, from the text already in memory.

There is no second filesystem watcher; the [project tree](/docs/workspace)
already runs one, and a file it reports as changed outside the editor is
rescanned on its own. When the tree cannot account for a change (many files at
once, for example), the index is marked stale and the next query walks the
project again. **Rebuild Symbol Index** (`index.rebuild`) forces that walk.

It honours your `.gitignore` the same way Find in Files and the project tree do,
skips files over 2 MB, and is bounded at 20,000 files and 400,000 symbols so
that it cannot grow without limit in the background.

### It under-reports on purpose

When the scanner isn't sure, it records nothing. A missing declaration costs
you one fallback to search, while an invented one sends you somewhere that
doesn't exist.

The index is a **fallback** for when no language server is running. Where a
[language server](/docs/lsp) is running it is better at this in every respect,
so use **LSP: Go to Symbol in Workspace** (`lsp.gotoSymbol`) there.

Turn it off in **Settings → Editor → Display** ("Project symbol index"), or with
`view.toggleSymbolIndex`. Disabling it releases the project's symbols.

## Sticky scroll

**Sticky scroll** pins the enclosing scope headers above the viewport, so deep
in a long method you can still see the class, the method and the block it
belongs to. Clicking a pinned row jumps to that header.

Two rules make it stay out of the way:

- **A header already on screen is not pinned.** Pinning it would cover the real
  line with a copy of itself.
- **When the chain is deeper than the cap (5 rows), the *outermost* entries are
  kept.** The innermost scope is the one you can infer from the code in front of
  you; the file-level type has been off screen longest.

Rows are rebuilt from the highlighting the editor has already applied, so they
match what's on screen and cost no extra tokenizing. It's on by default, and off in
[large-file mode](/docs/troubleshooting#performance) along with the other per-viewport work.
Toggle it in **Settings → Editor → Display** or with `view.toggleStickyScroll`.

## Peek Definition

**LSP: Peek Definition** (`lsp.peekDefinition`) shows a definition *over* the
editor and leaves your place, scroll position and tab count where they were.

Often all you need from a definition is its signature and a few lines of body,
and that isn't worth leaving your place for. The peek shows a couple of lines of
context and a dozen of the definition, syntax-highlighted. **Enter** makes the
real jump and **Esc** dismisses the peek.

A library target with no file to read degrades to the full go-to-definition
rather than reporting a failure.

Needs a [language server](/docs/lsp) for the file.

## Go to Definition in a Split

**LSP: Go to Definition in Split** (`lsp.gotoDefinitionInSplit`) puts the
definition in a new [editor group](/docs/workspace#editor-groups-two-files-at-once) and leaves the
origin where it was, so the call and the thing called are on screen together.

A definition in the *same file* jumps without splitting: there's only one tab, so
the split would move it and leave the group it came from empty.

## Preview tabs

Browsing uses one tab however many files you glance at. Arrowing through a
picker, or following a definition to see what something is, reuses a single slot
whose title is **italic** to show that it is not permanent yet, the same idea as
the unsaved marker.

It becomes a permanent tab when you commit to it:

- **editing the file** promotes it, and
- **opening it explicitly** (from the file finder, the project tree, anywhere
  that isn't a glance) promotes it.

An already-open file is **never demoted** into the slot. You opened it on
purpose, and in the slot it would be replaced the next time you glanced at
something else. A file with unsaved changes is never reused either.

## Go to Related File

**Go: Related File** (`nav.relatedFile`) pairs a file with its counterpart: a
test and the class it tests, a header and its implementation, a component and its
stylesheet. It works in both directions, and from a test the class under test is
offered first.

| From | Offers |
| --- | --- |
| `Foo.java` | `FooTest.java`, `FooTests.java`, `FooSpec.java`, `FooIT.java` |
| `FooTest.java` | `Foo.java` |
| `test_foo.py` | `foo.py` |
| `foo.c` | `foo.h` |
| `foo.cpp` | `foo.hpp`, `foo.hxx`, `foo.h` |
| `Button.tsx` | `Button.css`, `Button.scss` |
| `app.js` | `app.css`, `app.scss`, `app.html` |
| `x_test.go`, `x.test.ts`, `x.spec.ts` | `x.go`, `x.ts` |

These are conventions, so Editora proposes candidate names in preference order
and offers only the ones that **exist**. A convention that doesn't hold in your
project costs nothing, which is why the list can be generous. A
counterpart rarely sits beside its partner (a test lives under `src/test`, a
header under `include`), so the sibling directory is only the first place looked;
the [symbol index](#go-to-symbol-in-project) knows every file in the project and
finds the rest.

One match opens. Several offer a picker, since `Foo.css` and `Foo.scss` can both
exist and only you know which was meant.

## Keeping your place

Three things work together here, and each is documented where it lives:

- [**Back and forward**](/docs/navigation#back-and-forward) steps through the
  jump list.
- [**Recent Locations**](/docs/navigation#recent-locations) lists the session's
  trail with the line you were on, and previews as you arrow through it.
- [**Bookmarks**](/docs/bookmarks-notes) mark places you want to return to
  deliberately, and a **mnemonic** turns one into a single chord.

Bookmarks have default chords. Back, Forward and Recent Locations do not, and
neither do Go to Symbol in Project, Peek Definition, Go to Definition in Split
and Related File. Bind the ones you use from **Settings → Keymaps**.
