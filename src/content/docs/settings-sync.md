Settings sync keeps four kinds of personal data the same on every computer you
use Editora on. The data travels through a **Git repository you own**; there is
no Editora account and no Editora server. It is **off by default**.

## What is synced

| Data | File in the [config folder](/docs/configuration) |
| --- | --- |
| Snippets | `snippets/<language>.json` |
| Abbreviations | `abbreviations.json` |
| Templates | `templates/<id>.json` |
| Personal dictionary | `dictionary.txt` |

Each of the four has its own switch under **What to sync**, so you can leave
one out.

Nothing else is synced. Preferences (`settings.json`), keymaps and key
rebinds, macros, themes, plugins, and session state stay on the computer they
were made on. The **What to sync** card says so too.

## Setting it up

You need `git` installed and a Git repository that is either empty or already
used for sync by another of your computers. Use a **private** repository:
snippets and templates can contain private text.

1. Open **Settings → Sync**, or run **Settings Sync: Set Up…** (`sync.setup`).
2. Paste the repository's URL into **Repository**, for example
   `git@github.com:you/editora-sync.git`, and check the **Branch**.
   When the [GitHub CLI](/docs/github) is installed and signed in, **Create on
   GitHub…** asks for a name, creates a private repository, and fills the URL
   in.
3. Click **Connect**.

The **Repository** field does not take a URL with a password or token in it
(`https://me:TOKEN@host/…`, or a token used as the user name): the field turns
red, says why, and nothing is saved. Such a URL would sit in plain text in your
settings. Sign in through a Git credential helper instead (for GitHub,
`gh auth setup-git`), or use an SSH URL. A **Branch** name that Git would
refuse, such as `a..b`, turns that field red the same way and is not saved.

Connect looks at the repository before anything changes. If it already holds
data, a dialog states how many entries would arrive on this computer, how many
this computer would send, and how many differ on both. Nothing is removed on
either side by connecting. While it looks, **Cancel** stops waiting; nothing
changes on either side.

If Connect cannot go ahead (the repository or branch is missing, the repository
cannot be reached, or GitHub reports an error), the **Status** row says why. The
reason stays there until you edit the repository, try again, or disconnect.

Repeat the same steps on each other computer, with the same URL.
**Disconnect** stops syncing on this computer and leaves the repository and
your local files as they are.

## When it syncs

With **Sync automatically** on, Editora syncs:

- a few seconds after startup,
- about half a minute after you change a snippet, an abbreviation, a template,
  or the dictionary, and
- at the interval set on the page (15 minutes by default), while an Editora
  window has the focus.

**Settings Sync: Sync Now** (`sync.now`) and the **Sync Now** button run one on
demand. A file you edit by hand in the config folder is picked up by the next
timed sync.

The **Status** row shows when the last sync ran and what it did, for example
"3 received, 1 sent". Changes that arrive are applied to every open window
without a restart.

## How changes merge

Changes merge **entry by entry**, not file by file: one snippet, one
abbreviation, one dictionary word. Two computers that each added a snippet to
the same language both end up with both. A template is merged as a whole file.

When the **same entry** was changed on two computers, the computer that syncs
keeps its own version. The other version is not lost: it stays in the
repository's Git history. The status row names the entries this happened to.

A file that cannot be read on either side, or that was written by a newer
Editora, is left alone on both sides and named in the status row.

A sync that would remove more than half of a category that holds ten or more
entries stops and asks first: the Sync page shows **Sync Anyway**. This keeps a
damaged file on one computer from emptying the others.

## Backups

Before a sync replaces or deletes a file in your config folder, it copies that
file to `sync/backups/<timestamp>/` in the config folder. The last ten sets are
kept. **Open Sync Folder** on the Sync page opens the folder.

## Credentials and failures

Editora signs in to the repository with **your own Git credentials or SSH
key**, the same ones `git` uses in a terminal, and stores none of its own.

A repository URL saved with a password or token in it, before the field refused
them, is still in your settings. The Sync page then shows a warning above the
repository with two buttons. **Remove from URL** saves the URL without the
secret; the next sync signs in with your credential helper or SSH key, so set
one up first. **Keep for now** hides the warning until Editora starts again.
**Export Configuration…** always leaves such a secret out of the archive.

With more than one account in the [GitHub CLI](/docs/github) (a personal and a
work account, switched with `gh auth switch`), sync does not depend on which
one is active. It finds out which of your `gh` accounts can read the
repository, remembers that account's name on this computer, and signs in as it
from then on; the **Status** row on Settings → Sync names the account. This
applies to an `https://` repository on a host `gh` is signed in to. An SSH URL
or another credential helper signs in the way your `git` does. Either way Git
asks `gh` for the token, and Editora never sees or stores it.

A Git configuration that rewrites the repository URL (an insteadOf rule, for
example one that turns GitHub HTTPS URLs into SSH ones) does not affect sync:
the repository is recognised by the URL you entered.

An automatic sync never asks for a password or a passphrase and never opens a
dialog. If it fails, the reason appears once in the status bar and a
**Sync ⚠** segment stays there until a sync succeeds; clicking it opens
Settings → Sync. A sync you start yourself with Sync Now may use your Git
credential helper.

If a sync cannot reach the repository, nothing changes locally and the next
sync tries again. A sync interrupted part-way is repeated in full by the next
one.

When two Editora processes share one config folder (see
[`--new-instance`](/docs/cli#one-editor-not-two)), only the first one syncs.
