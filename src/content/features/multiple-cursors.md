Edit many places at once, VS Code-style. Add a caret at the **next occurrence** of the selection, or **above / below** the current line, or **Alt-drag** a column/box selection. Type, and the edit fans out to every caret; `Esc` collapses back to one.

It's powered by Editora's RichTextFX fork, which adds multiple cursors and column selection as a layered input map that's completely transparent when there's a single caret.

*Note:* movement chords act on the primary caret and don't fan out, use the arrow keys for multi-caret movement.
