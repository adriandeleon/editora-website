Edit files on a remote host over **SSH/SFTP**. *Remote: Connect to SFTP…* mounts the remote folder as the Project tree, and from there editing, syntax highlighting, search, bookmarks, notes, and preview all work over the wire, Save writes straight back.

Auth supports your default `~/.ssh` keys, a key file, or a password; connections are remembered (without secrets). Off by default; local-only features (running, LSP, Git) are gated off for remote files.
