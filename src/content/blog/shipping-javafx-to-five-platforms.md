Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag to Editora produces native installers and runnable jars
for five targets: Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64. Getting
there involved more sharp edges than the feature work did. Here's the shape of
it.

## No cross-building

jpackage and JavaFX are host-specific: you build a macOS DMG on macOS, a Windows
MSI on Windows, and so on. So the release workflow is a **five-way matrix**, each
target on its own GitHub-hosted runner, each building for *itself* with the same
`-Pdist` profile. There's no clever cross-compilation; there's five machines.

Each runner also builds a **per-platform fat jar**. You might expect one
portable jar, but that's impossible: JavaFX's macOS/Linux x64 and arm64 native
libraries share filenames and would collide in a single archive. So the fat jar
bundles natives **for the build host only**, and the release ships one per
platform.

## Automatic modules vs. jlink

Editora is a proper JPMS module, and the `dist` build uses `jlink` to produce a
trimmed runtime. The problem: several key dependencies: RichTextFX (and its
reactfx/flowless/undofx/wellbehavedfx friends), tm4e, PDFBox, lsp4j, are
**automatic modules**, which jlink refuses to link.

The fix is the `moditect` plugin, which injects generated `module-info`
descriptors into those jars at build time so jlink will accept them. Bump one of
those dependencies and you sometimes have to adjust the injected `requires`.
That's the tax for living on automatic modules.

There's an even sharper edge with tm4e: it ships as a NetBeans repackaging
that's **code-signed**, and jlink rejects signed modular jars. So the build
strips `META-INF/*.SF,*.RSA,*.DSA,*.EC` from it before linking.

## The one platform that's missing

Windows-on-ARM gets the x64 installer (run under emulation), not a native ARM64
build. A hosted `windows-11-arm` runner exists now, but OpenJFX 25 publishes no
`win-aarch64` native jar on Maven Central ([JDK-8314064]), so a native ARM64
build literally can't link. It's on the list for whenever JavaFX ships those
natives.

## Assembling the release

Every runner uploads its installer (renamed to a consistent
`Editora-<version>-<target>.<ext>`) and its fat jar. A final job hands them all
to [JReleaser](https://jreleaser.org), which creates the GitHub release with the
installers, jars, a `checksums.txt`, and a changelog. JReleaser only
*orchestrates*. It doesn't build, and there's no `pom.xml` change for it, so the
normal build is unaffected.

## What I'd tell someone starting out

If you're packaging a JVM desktop app: expect the matrix (no cross-building),
budget time for the automatic-module/jlink dance, and check early whether your UI
toolkit even *has* natives for every arch you want to ship, because "we'll add
ARM later" can turn out to mean "we can't, yet," and it's better to know that
before you promise it.
